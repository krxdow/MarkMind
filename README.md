# **AI Bookmark Organizer - Web Extension**

## **Description**
AI Bookmark Organizer is a web extension currently under development that uses artificial intelligence to automatically organize and categorize your bookmarks. Our goal is to make bookmark management more efficient by grouping similar content into thematic categories, enabling quick and easy access to your favorite resources.

## **Features (In Progress)**
- **Bookmark Retrieval**: The extension extracts your bookmarks and their metadata (titles, descriptions, etc.).
- **AI Analysis**: Bookmarks are sent to a server to be analyzed and categorized by an AI model.
- **Intelligent Categorization**: The AI groups bookmarks based on common themes, creating organized folders.
- **User Interface**: An intuitive interface to view and interact with your organized bookmarks.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Web Extension**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Data Transmission**: Uses JSON for data exchange between the extension and the server.
- **AI and Algorithms**: Integrates an AI API (such as ChatGPT or Mistral) for analysis and categorization.

## **Installation (Coming Soon)**
Detailed instructions on how to install and use the extension will be provided as the project progresses.
